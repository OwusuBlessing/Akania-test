if "chat_history" not in request.session:
    request.session["chat_history"] = []

# Context-aware AI prompting
if chat_history:
    for item in chat_history[-10:]:  # Last 10 exchanges
        messages.append(("human", item["user_message"]))
        messages.append(("assistant", item["ai_response"]))
```
